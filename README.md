Awesome idea! üî•  
You want to **build a Google Classroom clone** (without Google Meet/video calling part), using **Spring Boot** for backend and **React** for frontend.

Let's break this into clear parts to plan it properly:

---

## ‚ú® Project Name Idea
- **EduRoom**
- **ClassHub**
- **LearnSpace**
- (You can pick your own too.)

---

## üìö Key Features to Include (Like Google Classroom)

| Feature | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Authentication** | Signup/Login with roles: Student and Teacher. |
| **Class Management** | Teachers can create classes; Students can join classes with a code. |
| **Post Announcements** | Teachers can post announcements or assignments. |
| **Assignment Submissions** | Students can upload files/submit text responses. |
| **Grading** | Teachers can grade submissions. |
| **Commenting** | Students can comment under posts/assignments (optional at first). |
| **Profile Management** | Basic profile info for each user. |
| **Notification System** | Notifications when assignments are posted or graded. (Optional V1) |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend (Spring Boot)**:
  - Java + Spring Boot
  - Spring Security (for login/signup/auth)
  - JPA (Hibernate) + MySQL or PostgreSQL (DB)
  - JWT (Token-based authentication)

- **Frontend (React)**:
  - React.js
  - React Router (for navigation)
  - Axios (to call backend APIs)
  - Redux (if you want to manage auth/user info globally, optional for V1)

- **Tools/Other**:
  - Postman (API testing)
  - Swagger UI (for documenting APIs)
  - GitHub (code hosting)

---

## üìã How the Project Will be Structured

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- `/api/auth` ‚Üí Signup, Login APIs
- `/api/classes` ‚Üí CRUD classes (create/join/view)
- `/api/posts` ‚Üí Create posts (announcements/assignments)
- `/api/submissions` ‚Üí Students submit their work
- `/api/grades` ‚Üí Teachers grade submissions

**Entities**:
- User (id, name, email, password, role)
- Class (id, name, code, description, createdBy)
- Post (id, classId, createdBy, content, type (announcement/assignment))
- Submission (id, postId, studentId, file/url, submittedAt)
- Grade (id, submissionId, marks, feedback)

### Frontend (React)
- Pages:
  - LoginPage
  - SignupPage
  - DashboardPage (list of joined/created classes)
  - ClassDetailsPage (view posts in a class)
  - PostDetailsPage (view one post + submit assignment if it's an assignment type)
  - CreateClassPage
  - JoinClassPage
  - CreatePostPage
  - ProfilePage
  
- Components:
  - Navbar
  - ClassCard
  - PostCard
  - SubmissionForm
  - GradeForm

## üéØ MVP Plan (Minimum Viable Product)

| Week | Task |
|:---|:---|
| Week 1 | Set up Spring Boot backend: User auth, Class creation/joining. |
| Week 2 | Set up React frontend: Login, Signup, Class dashboard. |
| Week 3 | Add Posts (announcements/assignments) functionality. |
| Week 4 | Add Submissions and Grading. Finish core project. |

---

## üöÄ Future Upgrades (After MVP)
- Notifications (Assignment posted, Assignment graded).
- Drag and drop file uploads.
- Pagination and search in classes/posts.
- Add profile pictures.
- Add real-time updates (Socket.io / WebSocket).
- Dark mode on frontend!
