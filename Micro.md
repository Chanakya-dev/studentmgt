Perfect! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥  
You want to build your **Google Classroom Clone** using **Microservices Architecture** with **Spring Boot** + **React**.

That's a fantastic idea â€” it will make your system more **scalable**, **organized**, and **real-world** level.

# ðŸ›  Updated Architecture (Microservices Approach)

Instead of ONE big Spring Boot app, we'll **split into smaller microservices**.

| Microservice | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| **Auth Service** | Login, Signup, JWT token generation, Role management. |
| **User Service** | Managing profile info (name, profile pic, bio etc). |
| **Classroom Service** | Manage Classes: Create, Join, List classes. |
| **Post Service** | Manage Posts (announcements, assignments). |
| **Submission Service** | Students submit assignments; Teachers grade them. |
| **Notification Service** (Optional Later) | Send notifications to students/teachers. |

---

# ðŸ§  Flow Overview

- **Auth Service**: Handles login/signup, gives JWT token.
- **User Service**: Handles user profiles.
- **Classroom Service**: Create and Join classes.
- **Post Service**: Posts/Assignments inside a class.
- **Submission Service**: Upload submissions and get graded.

**Gateway / API Gateway** will handle routing all requests to correct services.

**Service Discovery (like Eureka)** can help in registering services dynamically.

# ðŸ“š Technologies you will need

| Layer | Technology |
|:---|:---|
| Backend | Java + Spring Boot (microservices) |
| API Gateway | Spring Cloud Gateway |
| Service Discovery | Eureka Server (Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka) |
| Authentication | JWT Token |
| Database | Separate databases for each service (ex: MySQL, PostgreSQL) |
| Communication between services | REST APIs (initially) / Later maybe Feign Clients |
| Frontend | React.js (single frontend that talks to API Gateway) |
| Others | Docker (optional, for containerizing each service) |

# ðŸ—º High Level Architecture Diagram

[React Frontend] --> [API Gateway] --> [Discovery Server (Eureka)]
                                               |
         ---------------------------------------------------------------
         |                  |                  |                     |
   [Auth Service]     [User Service]     [Classroom Service]     [Post Service]  
                                                              |
                                                        [Submission Service]
```

# ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Microservices Plan

| Step | Task |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | Create Discovery Server (Eureka Server). |
| 2 | Create API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway). |
| 3 | Build Auth Service: Signup/Login with JWT. |
| 4 | Build User Service: View/Edit profile. |
| 5 | Build Classroom Service: Create/Join classes. |
| 6 | Build Post Service: Announcements/Assignments under classes. |
| 7 | Build Submission Service: Students submit and teachers grade. |
| 8 | Connect all services via Eureka and route through API Gateway. |
| 9 | Build Frontend React app: login/signup/dashboard etc. |

# ðŸ“‹ Example APIs (Quick idea)

**Auth Service**
- POST `/auth/signup`
- POST `/auth/login`

**User Service**
- GET `/users/me`
- PUT `/users/me/update`

**Classroom Service**
- POST `/classes`
- GET `/classes`
- POST `/classes/{classCode}/join`

**Post Service**
- POST `/posts` (announcement or assignment)
- GET `/posts/class/{classId}`

**Submission Service**
- POST `/submissions/{postId}`
- GET `/submissions/class/{classId}`
- PUT `/submissions/{submissionId}/grade`

---

# âš¡ Future Enhancements (Once basic version is ready)
- RabbitMQ/Kafka (for async notification system).
- Redis (for caching classes/posts).
- Docker Compose (for running all microservices easily).
- Centralized Logging (ELK Stack maybe).
- Circuit Breakers (Resilience4j) for API Gateway resilience.
